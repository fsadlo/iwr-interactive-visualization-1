- Prototype: [source code](docs), [preview](https://ssciwr.github.io/iwr-interactive-visualization/)

TO Do
- Adjust font size in methods, applications, and groups to fit entities
- Remove method_groups and application_groups. Replace this information by nonzero wheight from method_weights and application_weights. When hovering on methods or applications, the groups should also be made "opaque" according to respective weight
- Force-directed layout of group boxes (inside ring), with selectable sorting (PI name or group name)
